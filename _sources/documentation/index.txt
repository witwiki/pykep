PyKEP Documentation
===================

PyKEP is made of main modules called :ref:`core`, :ref:`planet`, :ref:`simsflanagan`, :ref:`phasing`, :ref:`trajopt`, :ref:`orbitplots`, :ref:`util`. When we import PyKEP via::

  import PyKEP as pkp

the core module gets imported in the PyKEP namespace, while all other modules will appear in dedicated namespaces, e.g. 
PyKEP.trajopt, PyKEP.phasing etc.

In addition, two important dictionaries will be imported::

  pkp.__version__
  pkp.__extensions__

The first one, pkp.__version__, is the PyKEP version dictionary that can be queried for major, minor or bugfix number. PyKEP 1.2.0 
means that the major version is 1, the minor is 2 and the bugfix version is 0.

The second one, pkp.__extensions__, is the PyKEP extension dictionary containing the extension installed in the system as detected by PyKEP.
For example::

  {'matplotlib': True,
 'mplot3d': True,
 'pygmo': True,
 'scikit-learn': True,
 'scipy': True}

.. note::

   PyKEP follows two conventions that are to be kept in mind.

   * :emphasis:`Units`: The S.I. system is used to perform all computations in PyKEP and it is the default choice for everything. In some cases, to help the user instantiate objects and define problems, classes and functions may accept inputs in different units or return results in different units, but this is only exceptional and documented in the class or function help.

   * :emphasis:`Orbital parameters`: In PyKEP, the osculating Keplerian elements are always in the following order: a,e,i,W,w,M (E or H), where a is the semi-major axis, e the eccentriciy, i the inclination, W the Right Axcension of the Acending Node, w the argument of perigee and M the mean anomaly (E and H being the eccentric and hyperbolic anomalies).
